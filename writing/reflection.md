## Pre-Experiment Thinking

### 1. Algorithm Choice and Initial Reasoning

**Which algorithm(s) did you choose to study and why?**

Note: Explain your choice. What made this algorithm interesting to you?

TODO

**Before running any experiments, what did you predict would happen as input size increased?**
Note: Describe your initial prediction about performance patterns

TODO

## Experimental Results

### 2. Add your results from your favorite test below. From these finding were you able to see the pattern of its complexity? Why or why not?

**Copy and paste your experimental results here:**

TODO

```
(Paste your timing table from the program output here)

Example:
Size     | Time (sec)   | Ratio   | Operations  
---------|--------------|---------|------------
100      | 0.000012     | â”€       | 100
200      | 0.000024     | 2.00    | 200
400      | 0.000048     | 2.00    | 400
800      | 0.000096     | 2.00    | 800
```

**What pattern did you observe in the timing ratios?**

## Creative Reasoning and Analysis

### 3. Understanding the "Why"

**In your own words, explain WHY your algorithm shows this performance pattern. What specific steps in the algorithm lead to this complexity?**

Note: Think about what the algorithm actually does step-by-step. Why does it get slower (or not) as input grows?

TODO

### 4. From the plot that you generated, were you able to visually confirm the expected complexity? Why or why not?

Note: Discuss whether the visual representation matched your theoretical expectations.

TODO

### 5. Your take on thinks

**In two or three sentences (using clear and meaningful language), please summarize what you learned from this activity**
